# SnowCrash

This project is a modest introduction to the wide world of cyber security. A world where youâ€™ll have no margin for errors.


This project made me discover, through several little challenges, cyber security in various fields.
I used more or less complex methods that gave me a new perspective on IT in general.

This project aims to develop some logic thinking I learned for good and use in the future.
