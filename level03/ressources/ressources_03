2/ LTRACE
ltrace  is  a program that simply runs the specified command until it exits.  It intercepts and records
the dynamic library calls which are called by the executed process and the signals which  are  received
by that process.  It can also intercept and print the system calls executed by the program.
The ltrace command displays all the functions that are being called at run time from the library. In the below example, you can see the function names being called, along with the arguments being passed to that function. You can also see what was returned by those functions on the far right side of the output.
tltr: What it does: A library call tracer.
