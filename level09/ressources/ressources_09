1/ ls -la => Same configuration as in level08: level09 binary with SUID rights and a readable token file.

2/ We try a few things with the binary:
./level09 aaaaaaa
abcdefg

We understand that the binary shifts the chars in the argument by their index value in the argument.

3/ level09@SnowCrash:~$ gcc solve.c &&
./a.out `cat token`
